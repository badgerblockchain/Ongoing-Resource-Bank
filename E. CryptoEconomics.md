# CryptoEconomics
While the concept is not officially defined, cryptoeconomics is a notion of building networks with certain desired properties through the means of cryptography (using proof of work, hashes, digital signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs, to prove properties about messages that happened in the past) and economic incentives (using tokens and block rewards to encourage desired properties internally within the system to hold in the future).
