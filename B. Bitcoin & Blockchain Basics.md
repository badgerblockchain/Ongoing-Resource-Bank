# Bitcoin and Blockchain Basics
Created in 2008 by the anonymous creator(s) 'Satoshi Nakamoto', Bitcoin, a digitalized networking system built upon various economic, cryptographic, and distributed system primitives addresses noteicable flaws within many gov't and central banking institutions by providing an alternative peer-to-peer means of exchange. Initially steeming from libertarian roots after 2009's global financial crisis, Bitcoin is the main inspiration by the current decentralized ecosystem we are just barely seeing from within blockchain technologies. Below, you'll find a high-level overview on what the Bitcoin network consists of.

#### Characteristics of Good Currency
While there is no definitive rule, there are a handful of general qualities a currency system needs to address:

**Acceptability**
* Do others even accept the currency in the first place? Because buying groceries with Monopoly money won't cut it for some.     <br>
  <br>
**Durablility**
* The currency should not easily deteriorate.
  <br>
  <br>
**Portability**
* Currency needs to be used so it can be easily and economically transported from one location to the next.
  <br>
  <br>
**Familiarity**
* Users need a currency that is easily distinguishable, both in terms of separate currencies (U.S. dollar vs. British Pound) and other values of that currency (i.e. $1 vs $100).
  <br>
  <br>
**Stability**
* Currency should resist major fluctuations in value. Fluctuating standards of value changing your unit of measure.
  <br>
  <br>
**Divisibility**
* The currency needs to be easily broken down ($100 <---> $50 <---> $20 <---> $10 <---> $5 <---> $1 <---> $.25 <---> $.10 <---> $.05 <---> $.01) to allow for precise transaction amounts.
  <br>
  <br>
**Homogeneity**
* All portions that make up the currency should be equal in value  
  <br>
  <br>
**Difficult to Counterfeit**
* Increasing currency supply will devalue present currency in the system.

#### FAQs...
 * What is A Satoshi? 
   * One Satoshi (or 0.00000001 BTC) is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin. It stems from the anonymous user Satoshi Nakamoto.
 * Why was 21 million BTC the limit to ever be created? 
   * While there are small reasons, there is actually no good reasoning... The importance however is the fixed supply.
