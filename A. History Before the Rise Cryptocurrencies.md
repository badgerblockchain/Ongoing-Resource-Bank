# History Before the Rise of Cryptocurrencies
Before the dominance of Bitcoin, alternative attempts were made for similar cryptographic-monetary schemes, reaching all the way back to the early 90s. While David Chaum's Digicash was the only idea to be implemented, all works would nonetheless leave a critical impact on Satoshi. Listed below are some of these early projects, a bit on the Cypherpunk movement, and two historical phases, the Silk Road and Mt. GOX, which were critical to crafting Bitcoin into what it is today and what it looks to be for the future ahead.
